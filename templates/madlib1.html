    Once upon a time, there where three {{ adjective }} pigs. One day their mother said, "{{ name }}, you need to find a {{ noun }} of your own." Little {{ name }} left home in search for {{ noun }} and found tasty {{ color }} 
    {% for tasty in food %} 
    {{ tasty }} 
    {% endfor %}. {{ name }} never found {{ noun }}, but had a very full and happy stomach.<br>
    THE END
    </p>
